    <h1>Modern Period</h1>
    <br>
    According to S.R. Maheshwari, the beginning of local government can be presumed from 1687, when the Madras City
    Corporation was established. Local government was established to share the burden of resources of the central and
    provincial governments. The year 1870 was a landmark when Lord Mayo passed a resolution suggesting the
    decentralization of powers and the necessity of associating Indians in administration. The 1880 Famine Commission
    also indicated the necessity of the local bodies at the village level for famine relief works. Lord Ripon came as
    the Viceroy in 1880. The Local Self-government Resolution, 1882 was the most important act of his tenure. Local
    boards were established in rural areas. Districts and tehsils were formed. Functions and sources of revenue were
    allotted to such local bodies. The local self-government acts were passed in many provinces, Local boards could be
    superseded in case of abuse of powers, The British bureaucracy did not think of Indians as mature and experienced
    enough for local self-government. Until 1947, the local government was in the state of rejuvenation and
    reconstruction.<br><br>
    The spirit of democratic decentralization at the village level was existent right since the ancient period. It
    became more and more organized and took proper shape by the time India became independent in 1947. The Village
    Panchayats were a part of the ideology of Indian National Movement. Gandhiji had given the idea of 'Gram Swarajya':
    "The Government of the village will be conducted by the panchayat of five persons annually elected by the adult
    villagers, males and females, possessing minimum prescribed qualifications. These will have all the authority and
    jurisdiction required. Since there will be no system of punishment in the accepted sense, the panchayat will be
    legislature, judiciary and executive combined to operate for its year of office. Any village can become such
    republic today... Here there is perfect democracy based on individual freedom. The individual is the architect of
    his own government." Gandhiji considered Gram Swaraj to have self-sufficiency in villages where people would be
    self-dependent and have an autonomous self-government. Acharya Vinoba Bhave organized the 'Gram Daan' movement. Many
    villages were donated. People became masters. There was perfect swarajya. The Gram Sabha exercised all the powers in
    the village.<br><br>
    Within the Indian federal architecture panchayat is the closest to the notion of direct democracy distinct from the
    representative democracy of the Union and States, due to its proximity to the community it serves. Panchayats has
    deep faith in democracy in which the common man in the rural area has a huge capacity to have a good living for
    himself and the community under the healthy environment that the State creates. If a common man appears to be
    indifferent to the high economic growth, it is because he is devoid of the mainstream national development and has
    not been provided equal opportunity to participate in activities for his own betterment. The objectives of a
    panchayat include organizing common men in the process of developing themselves through their own efforts on a
    continuing basis, at the same time, enhancing their capacity and self-reliance. This begins with citizen
    participation in political processes and service delivery of local public goods, e.g. potable drinking water,
    general sanitation, primary health, elementary education, maintenance of public properties etc. Hence, the key
    objective of the panchayat is to balance the two values of ‘citizen participation’ and 'service delivery’.



    <br>
    <br>

    <h3 style="color:white;">Year: 1947-1957</h3>

    During this era, Mahatma Gandhi's conception regarding the Village Panchayat as the primary grass roots level
    democratic unit prevailed. People's participation came to be considered as necessary so that India's perception as a
    welfare state could be fulfilled. According to Gandhiji, "greater the power of the panchayat, the better for the
    people as true democracy".
    Community Development Programme (CDP) was started in 1952 to motivate the rural people to take community-based
    approach for the improvement of the economic and social condition of their life. The government was expected to
    provide general guidance and technical-cum-financial assistance in some blocks in a phased manner. National
    Extension Service (NES) was also introduced in 1953, as a prelude to community development in various blocks. The
    programmes were more or less bureaucratic and excessively politicized. SDO-cum-BDO fulfilled the local demands like
    road, drinking water wells, panchayat ghar, school building, etc. All schemes were treated as government schemes
    rather than people's programmes.

    <br>
    <br>

    <h3 style="color:white;">Year: 1957-1961</h3>
    Complaints of wastage of funds, corruption, malpractices and favouritism began to mar the public image of the
    development process. A study team under the chairmanship of Balwant Rai Mehta was appointed in 1956 to critically
    review the CDP and NES and suggest measures for effecting economy and improving efficiency in implementation of
    schemes. At the same time, the Planning Commission had already been advocating that Village Panchayats should be
    strengthened and given the responsibility for taking over development administration.
    <br>
    <br>

    At the village level, members were elected directly, except in Bihar. In Bihar, four members
    were directly elected, whereas the other four were nominated by the Mukhia, who was
    directly elected by the electorate.
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3 style="color:white;">Year: 1959-1965</h3>
    Rajasthan was the first state where Panchayati Raj was established on 2nd October, 1959. Pandit Nehru kindled the
    lamp at Nagaur to inaugurate Panchayati Raj. Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu followed it in 1959, Assam, Karnataka,
    Orissa, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh in 1960-61, Maharashtra, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Kashmir decided not to have
    multi-level Panchayati Raj and gave more powers to the Village Panchayats. In several states like Rajasthan, Bihar,
    Madras, Mysore and Orissa, powers were largely devolved on the middle-level tier, e.g., Panchayat Samiti, for
    undertaking a substantial number of development functions and the Zila Parishad was mainly responsible for advising,
    guiding, supporting and supervising the Panchayat Samitis and also to consolidate the plan proposal at the district
    level. It would also be a watch dog of the state in the district and would advise the state government on general
    and financial matters relating to Panchayati Raj in action.

    Rise and fall of Panchayati Raj (1965-78)
    Different states followed different systems of Panchayati Raj while Jammu & Kashmir followed a 1-tier, Haryana chose
    a 2-tier and Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh adopted a 3-tier system. Panchayat Samiti was more powerful in Rajasthan
    and Andhra Pradesh whereas Zila Parishad was more powerful in southern states. In the beginning, there was
    enthusiasm but it dwindled after the second panchayati elections in 1965 onwards.

    <h2 style="color:white;">Committees in Various States:</h2>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h3 style="color:white;">Ashok Mehta Committee (1977)</h3>
    The Government of India appointed the Ashok Mehta Committee in 1977 to study the role and powers of the PRIs in
    rural development and give suitable suggestions. This committee classified the period of 1962-64 as the
    establishment era for PRIS, 1964-69 as the period of dormancy and 1969-74 25 the period of decline.

    The committee was of the view that though the PRIs faced ups and downs, yet these institutions never failed. It
    suggested measures to strengthen the PRIs so that the system of democratic decentralization became effective for
    planning and development.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color:white;">CH. Hanumanth Rao Team (1982)</h3>

    The Planning Commission wanted effective people's participation through the PRIs in rural development so that plans
    are more responsive to people's needs and aspirations and there is coordinated as well as accelerated progress. The
    Planning Commission experts, under the leadership of Dr. C.H. Hanumanth Rao, were deputed to study as to how to
    prepare plans at the district level. He suggested that decentralization of planning should take place. Development
    plans have remained centralized, hence, participation of local people has been lacking. People should be associated
    right from the plan formulation stage.

    In 1984, the Prime Minister wrote to all the State Chief Ministers to take action without further delay to hold
    overdue elections to the PRIs.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color:white;">G.V.K. Rao Committee (1985)</h3>
    In 1985, the Union Government also appointed G.V.K. Rao Committee to advise on poverty alleviation programmes and
    organization of the PRIs. The committee advised for regular elections to the PRIs and formulation of plans at the
    district level.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color:white;">Laxmi Mal Singhvi Committee (1986)</h3>
    This committee was formed by the Government of India to suggest steps for revival of Panchayati Raj. It advocated
    that Panchayati Raj should primarily be viewed as the local self-government system and should be strengthened
    accordingly. It is the foundation stone for the country's democratic political system. Management of rural
    development was its secondary role. The existing constitutional provision in Article 40 is too general and also
    discretionary. It cannot give a firm basis for Panchayati Raj, which has been weakened due to neglect and
    unscrupulous politicking in various states. The committee advocated constitutional recognition to strengthen
    Panchayati Raj, which became the basis for the 64th Constitutional Amendment Bill.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color:white;">Workshops of Collectors (1987-88) and Conferences of Panchayati Raj Leaders</h3>

    The Department of Personnel and Administrative Reforms, Government of India, organized quite a number of workshops
    at Bhopal, Hyderabad, Imphal, Jaipur and Coimbatore where the Collectors of many districts discussed the subjects to
    be entrusted to Panchayati Raj at the district level. The importance of the PRIs was recognized for expediting
    development programmes in rural areas and in the interest of responsive administration. The workshops recommended
    that the list of functions of the PRIs should be incorporated in the Constitution of India. Functions like
    agriculture, animal husbandry, minor irrigation, social welfare, health, drinking water and social forestry were
    suggested to be included in the list of the functions to be delegated to the PRIs. All agreed on revamping the
    Panchayati Raj system.
    Conferences of Panchayati Raj leaders, including women, were also organized to know their views about the
    reorganization and strengthening of Panchayati Raj. The demands for de-bureaucratization of the control of
    Panchayati Raj as well as for devolution of more powers and resources were the focal issues in these conferences.
    As a result of these workshops and conferences, it was decided to amend the Constitution so as to provide protection
    to Panchayati Raj against negligence or arbitrary action by the state governments.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color:white;">P.K. Thungan Committee (1989)</h3>
    This committee recommended regular elections and according constitutional status to the PRIs and making the Zila
    Parishad the agency of planning and development.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3 style="color:white;">Harlal Singh Kharra Committee (1990)</h3>
    In Rajasthan, a committee was constituted under the chairmanship of the Panchayat Minister to study Panchayati Raj
    in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, etc., and suggest measures for strengthening Panchayati Raj in the state.
    The Rajasthan government also appointed a cabinet sub-committee in 1992 to study the Panchayati Raj system operating
    successfully in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh. The group visited these states and gave its
    recommendations. The State Government did not think it proper to bring about any structural changes like re
    organization of Panchayats into Mandal Panchayats, as recommended by this group. The decision was, of course, taken
    to reorganize all the panchayats, increasing their number from 7358 to 9184 after the reorganization process was
    completed.
    As a result of the recommendations of various such committees and the tempo generated, the Central Government
    decided to give a constitutional status to the PRIs and passed the 73rd Constitution Amendment Act in 1993 to
    provide uniformity to the Panchayati Raj system throughout India. Reservation to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes
    and women was also guaranteed by the Indian Constitution.
    Though most the state governments amended their Panchayati Raj Acts during 1993 and 1994, yet things have mostly
    remained on paper. Political will is still lacking. Powers, staff and resources to the PRIs have hardly been
    transferred. The PRIs still remain more an agency of development rather than institutions of self-government.
