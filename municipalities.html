    <h2 style="color:white;">Muncipalities History</h2>
    <h3 style="color:white;">Evolution of urban government in India</h3>
    The urban government in India emerged out of a centralized system of governance. Ancient India was a land of village
    republics but cities were also founded by rulers. Very little information is available about the cities and their
    administration in the Vedic period. During the Gupta period the towns were governed by a centrally appointed person
    called ‘Purpal’. The Purpal was assisted by a non official committee, the town committees were a common feature of
    the ancient Indian administration. In mediaeval times, the rulers at the centre could not look after the local
    affairs. They needed a local agency that could manage the local affairs with local collection of funds. Local
    administration was carried on by the representatives of the rulers. People were not associated with the management.
    ‘Kotwal’ in the Mughal administration managed local affairs without the accountability towards the people (Altekar
    1949).
    <br>
    <br>
    The centralized administration took the turn during colonial administration at the hand of the East India Company
    whose interest was trade and commerce, sanitary services for the British people, tax collection for the maintenance
    of police and maintaining law and order in the society. The purpose was not to create local self-government bodies.
    Local government in India has not grown from below. Even after 1858, Queen’s government showed no effort for
    organizing local government with people’s participation or accountability towards them. Lord Rippon’s Resolution of
    1882 conceded for the first time local administration by an elected body with local functions.
    <br>
    <br>
    The urban government could not strike roots even after hundred year of existence as the western model was imported
    from a different society. The freedom fighters also did not involve themselves in developing civic amenities but
    utilized local government to agitate for national freedom.
    <br>
    <br>
    Though the Constitution of India after much debate in the Constituent Assembly included Art. 40 in the Directive
    Principles to leave the provision of organizing panchayats in rural areas did not give any corresponding duty to the
    states with regard to the creation of urban bodies. The only reference to urban self government is to be found in
    two entries: 1) Entry 5of list 11 of the seventh schedule, viz., the state list says: ‘Local government, that is to
    say, the constitution and powers of Municipal Corporations, Improvement trusts, District Boards, mining settlement
    authorities and other local authorities for the purpose of local self government or village administration’. Entry
    20 of the concurrent list reads: ‘Economic and Social Planning, Urban Planning would fall within the ambit of both
    entry 5 of the State List and Entry 20 of the Concurrent list’. After independence, incomprehensive and inadequate
    municipal laws, substandard personnel, poor finance and stringent local control suppressed the growth of the urban
    government. ‘The state government followed an ambivalent policy towards municipal rule, while ceding powers on
    papers, actually put checks and restraints from exercising power by the local bodies (Bhattacharya 1976).The year
    1985 proved to be a land mark year as, during that year, the Ministry of Urban Development was set up at the Union
    level independently. Earlier it was shifted from one ministry to another .Despite the fast pace of urbanization,
    there is no well defined and thorough urbanization policy in India. The Constitution 65th Amendment Bill brought by
    the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi, sought to ensure municipal bodies being vested with necessary powers and
    removing their financial constraints to enable them to function effectively as units of local self-government.
    Though it was passed in Lok Sabha, the bill defeated in the Rajya Sabha in October 1989.
    <br>
    <br>
    In 1991, the Central government introduced a Constitutional Amendment Bill pertaining to municipalities in the Lok
    Sabha on 16 September. With a few modifications, it was essentially based on the 65th Amendment Bill. The Act
    introduces a new part, namely, Part IXA, in the Constitution. This part deals with issues relating to municipalities
    such as their structure and composition, reservation of seats, elections powers and functions, finances, and some
    miscellaneous provisions. The Seventy Fourth Amendment Act thus accords constitutional status to municipalities. The
    provisions of the Act apply to the states as well as the Union territories. However, in relation to the latter, the
    President can make certain reservations and modifications. The provisions do not apply to the Schedule Areas and
    Tribal Areas governed by Article 244(1) and (2) of the Constitution.
    <br>
    <br>
    The traditional civic functions of municipalities are being performed by municipal bodies. However, the 74t h
    Constitutional Amendment lays down that municipalities would go beyond the mere provisions of civic amenities. Now,
    they are expected to play a crucial role in the formulation of plans for local development and implementation of
    development projects and programs, including those specially designed for urban poverty alleviation.
