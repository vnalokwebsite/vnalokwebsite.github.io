      <div class="main_text_ancient spaceout">
        <h1>1. Vedic Age:</h1>

        Panch-Ayat' means a group of five persons selected by the villagers. Indirectly, it denotes the system through
        which rural people are governed. It indicates that there was some method of self-government. In the old Sanskrit
        scriptures, there is a word 'Panchayatan', which means a group of five persons, including some spiritual man.
        But, gradually, the concept of the inclusion of a spiritual man in such groups vanished. In the Rigveda, there
        is a mention of 'Sabha', 'Samiti' and 'Vidath' as local self-units.
        <br>
        <br> Subsequently, the panchayat became a group of any five selected persons of the village to decide village
        disputes. The concept of 'Panch Parmeshwar' or 'Panch-the God' existed in the ancient age. 'Yagna' or sacrifice,
        to be successful, must be done by five devoted persons as per the Vedic saying. It indicates the pious
        conscience of Panchas. There is a description of 'Sabha' and 'Samiti', which were the democratic bodies at the
        local level. The king used to get the approval of the 'Sabha' or 'Samiti' regarding certain functions and
        decisions.
        <br>
        <br>

        <h1>2. Epic Era:</h1>

        The study of the Ramayana indicates that administration was divided into two parts-'Pur' and 'Janpad' or city
        and village. Villages were 'Janpad' and the village people were called the 'Janpada'. 'Gram', 'Maha Gram' and
        'Ghosh' (village, big village and group of villages) are mentioned in the Ramayana. 'Pattan' were towns near
        villages and served as 'Mandi' or market for the villagers. 'Shreni' and 'Nigam' were there as local bodies but
        no description regarding their constitution is available in the Ramayana.
        <br>
        <br>
        Even in the Ramcharit-Manas by Tulsidas, the welfare of the people has been described as the main object of the
        ruler. The system of governance was divided into the rule of the king (Raj-Tantra), the rule of the people
        (Praja-Tantra) and the rule of the wise men (Vidvat-Tantra) or educated and knowledgeable persons. In the whole
        of the state, there was also a Caste Panchayat and one person elected by the Caste Panchayat was the member of
        the king's Council of Ministers. Thus, the king used to take the advice of all the caste representatives who
        were also ministers.
        <br>
        <br>
        Self-government of a village finds ample expression in 'Shanti Parva' of Mahabharata and Manu Smriti as well as
        in Kautilya's Arthashastra. 'Sabha' and 'Samiti' played a part in controlling the decisions of the king. As per
        the Mahabharata, over and above the village, there were units of 10, 20, 100 and 1,000 village groups. 'Gramik'
        was the chief official of the village. 'Dashap' was the chief of ten villages. 'Vinshya Adhipati', 'Shat Gram
        Adhyaksha' and 'Sahasra Gram Pati' were the chiefs of 20, 100 and 1,000, villages respectively. The lower
        village head would give information about special events to the higher village head. They used to collect local
        taxes and were responsible for protection of their villages. There were small and big towns. There was also
        'guptachar' (CID) system in towns to search for the offenders. The village heads also protected people against
        the cruelty of the king. 'Sabha Parva' of the Mahabharata mentions the Gram Panchayats but it is not clear
        whether the Panchas were elected by the people or nominated by the kings.
        <br>
        <br>
        Manu Smriti stresses on organized system of local self-government. It has highlighted the importance of the
        decentralization of the functions of the state. The king was advised to keep responsible ministers for advice.
        Manu has mentioned 'village' as a smallest unit of governance. Units of 10, 20, 100, 1,000 village groups were
        also a part of the system of self-government. 'Rakshak' (saviour) was responsible for the village. His function
        was to maintain law and order. Lower Rakshak owed responsibility to the higher Rakshak.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>3. Ancient Period</h1>

        Kautilya, in his Arthshastra advised the king to constitute units of villages having 100-500 families. There
        would be centres of 10 villages, 200 villages, 400 villages and 800 villages. These centres would be
        respectively known as 'Sangrahan', 'Karvatik', 'Drona Mukh' and 'Sthaneeya'. Town was termed as 'Pur'. Its chief
        was 'Nagrik'. Local bodies were free from any interference from the king's side.
        <br>
        <br>
        In Chandragupta Maurya's regime, the policy of decentralization of powers was adopted. The village was the
        smallest unit of governance. A person elected by the people of the village was the 'Gramik' (head of village).
        Magasthenese has described how Patliputra town was administered by six committees consisting of five members
        each.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the Gupta period also, the 'Gramik' was the village head and a village was the smallest unit of governance.
        The records of the Gupta period mention 'Gram Sabha', 'Gram Janpad' and 'Panch Mandli'.
        <br>
        <br>

        Neeti Shastra of Shukracharya also mentions village during this period.
        In South India, the 'Satvahan' kingdom existed in the 1st century B.C. There were local bodies for governance in
        the cities as well as the villages. The 'Chola' rulers also developed self-governance in the villages. 'Nadu
        Parishads' were representative bodies which were solely responsible for the maintenance of the villages.
        <br>
        <br>
        In northeastern India, there were small republics which were quite independent in internal matters. The Village
        Panchayats were vested with sufficient administrative powers and the king interfered the least.
